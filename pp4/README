Usage:
 1. run `make` to build dcc
 3. run `./dcc <$FILE` to process $FILE and output any semantic errors (assuming lexing and parsing succeeded)

Problems:
 - Under certain cases, my solution outputs interface compatibility checks out of order compared to the solution compiler (samples/bad6.decaf demonstrates this)

Extended Functionality:
 - I wrote many tests beyond those included in the samples directory.
   - They all match the regex "jon_*.decaf"
   - Mostly they just use examples from the instructions or fill in details mentioned in the spec
