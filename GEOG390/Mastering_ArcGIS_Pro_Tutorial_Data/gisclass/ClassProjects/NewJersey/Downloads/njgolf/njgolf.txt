  Description:
    Abstract: The shapefile represents the fairway, green and tee areas of all the golf courses in New Jersey.  It was created by selecting all recreation polygons from the 1995/97 NJDEP land use/land cover (LU/LC) file.  All recreation polygons were then compared to the 1995 digital aerial photographs to confirm the presence or absence of a golf course.  Golf course parcels were retained for the golf file.  Following this the Golf Digest Places to Play Travel Planner (DeLorme, 2000) software digest was compared to the golf courses parcels identified and names were added to each course.  Over 5 individual sources were examined to compile a complete listing of courses in New Jersey (public, private, regulation, executive size, etc.) .  The draft file was sent to Curtis Brown (Pesticide Regulation, NJDEP) for comparison against the pesticide permit files.  Several additions or corrections were made based on these NJDEP records, confirmed with telephone calls to the course in question.  Finally, all parcels were dissolved based on the course name.  There are 256 courses identified and 553 polygons (Many courses show as discontinuous polygons because fairways/green/tee zones are separated by tracts of wetland, forest or other land covers.  The purpose of the file is to determine course acreage to assist estimating the amount of pesticide, fertilizer, and herbicide used on an annual basis.  Therefore substantial (1 acre or more) tracts of forest or wetlands are not included in a course's polygons, although these areas may be owned by the Golf Course.
    Purpose:
      The data set will provide information for the Source Water Assessment Program (SWAP) to estimate the acreage and location of golf courses throughout the state.  From this information an estimated amount of fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide application can be calculated.  Because of this tracts of wetlands, forest, or other landcovers larger than the minimum mapping unit (1 acre) are not included in the golf course polygon description, though these areas may be owned by the course in question.  Therefore, most courses contain more than one discontiguous set of polygons.  (256 courses with 553 polygons).

      This data set is intended to serve as a resource for analysis rather than regulatory delineations. The NJDEP may change the line work based on more in depth analysis and field inspection for regulatory purposes.
    Supplemental_Information: This shapefile is a direct derivative of the NJDEP 1995/97 landuse/landcover files and the NJDEP digital orthophotography.  See the metadata for these files for a detailed discussion of original mapping methodology.  Users of this data are strongly urged to review the metadata for the 1995/97 and 1986 landuse/landcover shapefiles, the digital orthophotography, as well as others documents mentioned before using the data set.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Linework has the same accuracy as the landuse/landcover parent files.  The list of known courses was compiled and cross referenced from multiple sources (Golf Digest 2000, NJDEP Pesticide Program Files, LU/LC class codes, multiple web sites, The Department of Community Affairs listings, etc.).  All courses were photoidentified or reached by telephone for recent courses.  The file is as comprehensive as possible.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: none
  Completeness_Report: As far as available known reliable sources were used to compile the file and it is complete as of November 2001.  Compared to more sources than described as a number were rejected due to multiple obvious errors (www.play18.com, NJ Golf Association list, etc.).  This file is more accurate than individually referenced sources.  Because the purpose is to estimate fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide use ONLY fairways, greens, and teeboxes were identified.  Tracts of wetlands, forest, or other landcovers larger than 1 acre (minimum mapping unit) are not included in the golf course polygons even though these may be imbedded within the course in question.  As a result, most courses contain more than one discontinuous set of polygons, many with ""donut holes"".  (256 courses with 553 polygons).

          Geospatial_Data_Presentation_Form: remote-sensing image
          Other_Citation_Details: Digital images were created from 1:40000 scale NAPP CIR images by USGS, referenced in UTM, NAD83.  These images were then projected to New Jersey State Plane Feet Coordinates (NJSPF), NAD83, and compressed to JPEG images files.  These NJSPF compressed files were used in the development of the this data set. The original images in UTM are available from the USGS website.  The NJSPF versions are available from the NJDEP site.  Both sites have online and CD distribution of these images.

      Source_Contribution: Land use/land cover for 1995/97 was digitized directly from 1995/97 digital image files.  Photographic transparencies of the CIR images used to create the digital files were also viewed stereoscopically to aid in land use/land cover determinations.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        All polygons derived directly from the 1995/97 land use/land cover data set.  Initially all recreational polygons were reselected from the 1995/97 landuse/landcover file.  These were all compared to 1995 digital orthophotography to identify the presence or absence of a golf course.  All landuse/landcover polygons over photoidentifiable golf courses were retained,  regardless of their landuse/landcover designation (there was a small percentage of omissions and miscodings in the LU/LC file).  These were then compared to the Golf Digest Places to Play Travel Planner by DeLorma (2000) for completeness.  A significant number of additional courses were added which were not coded as recreational cover in the original LU/LC file. All were cross checked against the photography, or called if web sites indicated they were recent built.  The DeLorma travel planner was the source for the course names.  Courses were cross checked against the web site www.placestoplay site, and phoned to resolve name or location issues. This listing was compared to the NJDEP pesticide program list of golf courses until  discrepancies were resolved.  There are a few sites which clearly show as golf courses on the photos but are not part of any listings and may be very recent.  It should be noted that the purpose of the file is to estimate annual application and loads of fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide for the source water assessment program.  Thus significant tracts (greater than 1 acre) of forest or wetlands imbedded in the courses were not retained in the file, even though they may be part of the area owned by the golf course.  This is because these areas would not receive applications of fertilizers, etc.  Thus the file mainly depicts the fairway/tee/greens areas.  One implication of this is that most courses are composed of several non-contiguous polygons.

        Once all polygons were identified and selected,  they were dissolved based on course name.  Several other lists (from NJ Department of Community Affairs, from the golf association of NJ, from the Travel and Tourism bureau (NJ Commerce  Economic Growth Commission)), etc. were also examined.  None of these sources were as comprehensive or as up-to-date as the DeLorma and Pesticide Program listing and were discarded.  All landuse/landcover attributes were removed as a number of these were incorrect, due to original miscoding or the recent age of the course.
