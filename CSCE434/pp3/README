Usage:
 1. run `make` to build dcc
 3. run `./dcc <$FILE` to process $FILE and output any semantic errors (assuming lexing and parsing succeeded)

Extended Functionality:
 - I created 2 scripts to help test this project:
   - `test.sh $FILE` will compare the output of my compiler with the included solution compiler
   - `alltests.sh` will run test.sh on every file in the samples directory
 - I also wrote several tests beyond those included in the samples directory.
   - They all match the regex "jon_*.decaf"
   - Mostly they just use examples from the instructions or fill in details mentioned in the spec
