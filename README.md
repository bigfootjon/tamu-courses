# TAMU Undergraduate Coursework

This monorepo contains a significant amount of the code
from my time at TAMU. Unfortunately, it is missing some
work such as CSCE606 which had separate repos that are
now lost to me.

This repository as it exists right now was never this
noisy. I have reverted the deletion commits that hid
files for courses already completed, though original
history has been retained, so before the merge commits
the real git log can be seen.

Known missing courses:
* CSCE606
* CSCE410

This list is probably incomplete. A more careful
examination of the git log and course registrations
is required but deferred to when it might be required.
